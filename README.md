# Login Form Validation

This project demonstrates how to implement form validation for a login form using JavaScript and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The validation ensures that the email is in a valid format and the password meets the minimum length requirement.

## Features

- Validates email and password fields on form submission.
- Displays error messages only after form submission.
- Uses OOP principles for clean and maintainable code.

## Code Explanation
### Javascript (`formValidator.js`)
The JavaScript file contains the `FormValidator` class, which:
- Initializes the form and input fields.
- Adds an event listener for form submission.
- Validates the email and password fields.
- Displays or hides error messages based on the validation results.
